Interface for Using Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Mouse Sensors as a Windows Mouse / Input Device
Unlock the potential of the Nintendo Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 controllers by turning their built-in mouse sensors into fully functional input devices for Windows!

**ðŸ§  What is This?**

Each Joy-Con 2 in the Nintendo Switch 2 features an integrated optical mouse sensorâ€”likely for high-precision motion tracking in supported games. This project explores and utilizes that hidden hardware to enable new and exciting use cases on Windows PCs.

Whether you're a developer, a hardware tinkerer, or just a tech enthusiast, this project lets you dive deep into Nintendo's latest hardware and repurpose it in innovative ways.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goals**
- Document the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Sensor
Identify and analyze the optical sensor model used in Joy-Con 2 controllers, including resolution, polling rate, PID/VID and communication protocol.

- Dump & Decode Bluetooth Packets
Capture raw Bluetooth packet data sent from Joy-Con 2 devices to reverse-engineer how mouse movement data is transmitted.

- Enable Mouse Input on Windows
Create a reliable interface to map Joy-Con 2 sensor input to native Windows mouse input, making it usable in real-time.

**ðŸ“¦ Status**

ðŸš§ Work in progress.
We are currently analyzing packet data and validating sensor behavior. Contributions and Bluetooth dumps are welcome!

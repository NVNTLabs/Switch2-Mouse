# Switch2-Mouse

**NVNT's Joy-Con 2 Mouse Info Database & Repository**

For Using Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Mouse Sensors as a Windows Mouse / Input Device and general hardware info dump for the mouse sensor.

**ðŸ§  What is This?**

Each Joy-Con 2 in the Nintendo Switch 2 features an integrated optical mouse sensor for an alternative input method for supported games. This project explores and utilizes this hardware for utilization on Windows PCs.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goals**
- Document the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Sensor
Identify and analyze the optical sensor model used in Joy-Con 2 controllers, including resolution, polling rate, PID/VID and communication protocol.

- Dump & Decode Bluetooth Packets
Capture raw Bluetooth packet data sent from Joy-Con 2 devices to reverse-engineer how mouse movement data is transmitted using Nordic Semiconductor nRF Sniffer.

- Enable Mouse Input on Windows
Create a reliable interface to map Joy-Con 2 sensor input to native Windows mouse input, making it usable in real-time.

**ðŸ“¦ Status**

ðŸš§ Work in progress.
We are currently analyzing packet data and validating sensor behavior. Contributions and Bluetooth dumps are welcome!

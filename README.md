## How is this possible?

Utilizing a Nordic nRF52840-based Bluetooth sniffer to capture and analyze connection packets transmitted by the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers to the host device. This process includes identifying hardware-level details such as Product ID (PID), Vendor ID (VID), and other relevant descriptors.

For documentation purposes, this repo will also catalog as much detailed sensor information as possible such as LOD, Polling Rate, etc.

A long-term goal is to develop a custom driver that enables the Joy-Con 2 to function as a native mouse input device on Windows, complete with proper initialization sequences and motion reporting.
